  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  I am an AI/ML & Data Scientist at the <b>Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Reseach</b> <a href="https://www.pavir.org/about-us/who-we-are-1574200952/" target="_blank">(PAVIR)</a>, 
    where I design, develop, and validate machine-learning pipelines to guide clinical decision-making. 
    In this role, I’m also an affiliated researcher at Stanford Cardiovascular Medicine's <a href="https://heart.stanford.edu/lab/" target="_blank">Heart Lab</a>,
    working primarily under the supervision of <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/alexander-sandhu" target="_blank">Alex Sandhu</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before transitioning into data science, I started my career at UCSF as a new-graduate nurse on the medical-surgical step-down unit 
    and have since worked across all acute and step-down units, and the centralized telemetry unit. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I earned my PhD in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford's Department of Biomedical Data Science <a href="https://dbds.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">(DBDS)</a>, with a minor in Management of Science and Engineering <i></i>(MS&E).</i>
    My dissertation work was co-advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-baiocchi" target="_blank">Mike Baiocchi</a> 
    and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jonc101?tab=bio" target="_blank">Jonathan Chen</a>. 
  </p>
    
  <p> 
  Prior to Stanford, my US education journal began at City College of San Francisco, continued at San Francisco State University with a BS in Nursing. 
    Under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.nursing.sfsu.edu/larry-vitale" target="_blank">Larry Vitale</a>, and <a href="https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/f-javier-arsuaga" target="_blank">Javier Arsuaga</a>, 
    I went on to learn about Biostatistics through the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/summer-institute-biostatistics" target="_blank">SIBS</a> progam at Emory University.
    I then completed a MA in <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics" target="_blank">Biostatistics</a> from the University of California, Berkeley. My thesis work was advised by <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/alan-hubbard" target="_blank">Alan Hubbard</a>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm passionate about leveraging my clinical background, statistical training, and machine-learning research to improve clinical decision-making and drive better patient outcomes.

  <h4>Work</h4>

  <p>
  With over 15 years at the bedside, I understand the day-to-day pain points of clinical work and witnessed firsthand how evidence-based practices transform patient care. 
    That experience drives my passion for bridging the gap between frontline needs and scholarly advances. 
  </p> 

  <p>
  My work is at the intersection of machine learning and advanced statistical methods, with a focus on designing, evaluating, and integrating data-driven interventions into real-world health-system workflows.
    <br> As a graduate student, I built predictive models, estimated causal effects, and tackled clinical questions using large-scale healthcare data.
    In my post-PhD role, I’ve leveraged large-language models to mine clinical text and generate actionable insights.   
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My core areas of work include:
  </p>

  <ul class="spaced-list"> 
    <li><b>Data Analytics</b>: Extract insights from structured and unstructured EHR data using cloud-based infrastructures at Stanford Health Care and the Veterans Affairs.</li> 
    <li><b>Analytics Frameworks</b>: Enhance model development through problem reframing, rigorous evaluation, and continuous iteration.</li> 
    <li><b>Pragmatic Trial Design & Causal Inference</b>: Measure the causal impact of machine-learning–driven clinical interventions on patient outcomes.</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=oY7s6eoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">publications</a> 
  span multiple domains: clinical (nursing research in Nature Scientific Reports), statistical methodology (The American Statistician), and machine-learning–driven informatics (Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association).
